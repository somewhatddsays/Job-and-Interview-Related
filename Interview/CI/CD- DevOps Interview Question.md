# CI/CD - DevOps Interview Questions

---

## Beginner Level (1-20 Questions)

### 1. What is CI/CD in DevOps?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

**CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository, and automated tests are run to catch issues early.

**CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automates the deployment of software.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Requires manual approval before deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated, no manual intervention.

---

### 2. What are the benefits of using CI/CD?

- **Faster Releases:** Automates software delivery.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Runs tests automatically on new code.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Developers merge code frequently, reducing integration issues.
- **Consistent Deployments:** Eliminates manual errors with automated builds and releases.

---

### 3. What are some popular CI/CD tools?

- **Jenkins** – Open-source, highly customizable.
- **GitHub Actions** – Integrated with GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD** – Built-in with GitLab.
- **CircleCI, Travis CI** – Cloud-based solutions.
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline** – Cloud-native CI/CD.

---

### 4. What is a CI pipeline?

A CI pipeline is an automated workflow that builds, tests, and validates new code before merging it into production.

**Steps:** Code Commit → Build → Test → Artifact Storage → Deployment

**Example tools:** Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions YAML, GitLab CI/CD YAML

---

### 5. What is a build artifact in CI/CD?

A build artifact is a compiled and packaged version of code ready for deployment.

**Examples:**
- JAR, WAR, or ZIP files for Java projects
- Docker images for containerized applications

---

### 6. How does source control work in CI/CD?

Source control (e.g., Git) helps track changes in code.

Developers push code to repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). CI/CD tools trigger automated builds and tests on new commits.

---

### 7. What is the purpose of unit tests in CI/CD?

Unit tests validate individual components of code to catch early-stage bugs.

**Tools:** JUnit, pytest, Mocha, Jest

**Example:**
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

---

### 8. What is versioning in CI/CD?

Versioning assigns unique numbers to each software release to track changes.

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **Git Tags:** CI/CD pipelines deploy specific versions using tags.

---

### 9. What is a rollback in CI/CD?

A rollback reverts to a previous stable release when the new deployment fails.

**Example:** Rolling back an application using Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app
```

---

### 10. What is a canary deployment?

Canary deployment releases new changes to a subset of users before full deployment.

**Example:** Deploy to 10% of users → Monitor logs → Full release

---

## Intermediate Level (21-40 Questions)

### 21. What is the difference between GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD?

**GitHub Actions:**
- Integration: Best with GitHub
- Configuration: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Runners: GitHub-hosted & self-hosted
- Container Support: Uses Docker containers

**GitLab CI/CD:**
- Integration: Best with GitLab
- Configuration: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- Runners: GitLab Runners
- Container Support: Strong native container support

---

### 22. How do you trigger a Jenkins pipeline?

Jenkins pipelines can be triggered using:

- **Webhooks:** Automatically triggered by a Git commit.
- **Cron Jobs:** Run at scheduled times.
- **Manually:** Click 'Build Now' in Jenkins UI.

---

### 23. What is a deployment strategy?

Deployment strategies ensure smooth updates. Common types:

- **Rolling Deployment:** Replaces old instances gradually.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Deploys new version alongside the old one.
- **Canary Deployment:** Releases updates to a small group first.

---

### 24. How do you secure CI/CD pipelines?

- **Use Secrets Management** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Restrict Access:** Use role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Use tools like Snyk, SonarQube.

---

### 25. How do you integrate CI/CD with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Integrating CI/CD with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures that infrastructure changes are automated and version-controlled.

**Best Practices:**
- Store IaC scripts (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation) in Git.
- Use automated testing (e.g., terraform validate, ansible-lint).
- Apply changes using CI/CD pipelines (terraform apply).

**Example GitHub Actions Pipeline for Terraform:**
```yaml
jobs:
  terraform:
    steps:
      - run: terraform init
      - run: terraform validate
      - run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

### 26. What is a pipeline as code?

Pipeline as Code means defining CI/CD workflows using configuration files.

**Example tools:** Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions YAML, GitLab CI/CD YAML.

**Example Jenkinsfile:**
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } }
    stage('Test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } }
  }
}
```

---

### 27. What is an ephemeral build environment in CI/CD?

An ephemeral build environment is a temporary environment spun up only during the build process and discarded after execution.

Used in GitHub Actions Runners, Jenkins Agents, Kubernetes Jobs.

**Benefits:**
- Ensures clean state for each build.
- Reduces resource costs.

---

### 28. What is the purpose of a staging environment in CI/CD?

A staging environment replicates production to test before deployment.

**Why it matters:**
- Helps catch bugs before they reach production.
- Enables performance testing, security testing.

**CI/CD flow:** Dev → QA → Staging → Production

---

### 29. How does a monorepo impact CI/CD pipelines?

A monorepo is a single repository for multiple projects/services.

**Challenges:**
- Running CI/CD for only changed services can be complex.
- Large build times if not optimized.

**Solution:**
Use Bazel, NX, or GitHub Actions path filters to build/test only modified code.

---

### 30. What are pipeline triggers, and how are they used?

Triggers automatically start CI/CD workflows based on specific events.

**Examples:**
- **Git Push:** Run pipeline when new code is pushed.
- **Pull Requests:** Trigger tests before merging.
- **Schedule:** Run a job every night (cron).

**Example GitLab CI/CD trigger:**
```yaml
trigger:
  event: push
```

---

### 31. What is artifact versioning in CI/CD?

Versioning assigns unique identifiers to builds for tracking.

**Best Practices:**
- Use Semantic Versioning (1.2.3) for clarity.
- Tag artifacts using commit hashes (v1.0.0-commitSHA).

**Example:**
```bash
docker tag my-app:latest my-app:1.2.3
```

---

### 32. How do you handle environment variables in CI/CD?

Use `.env` files or CI/CD secrets storage.

**Example GitHub Actions Environment Variable:**
```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
```

**Best Practices:**
- Never hardcode secrets.
- Use tools like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager.

---

### 33. What is a multi-branch pipeline in CI/CD?

A multi-branch pipeline runs different workflows for different Git branches.

**Example (Jenkins):**
- `main` → Deploy to production.
- `develop` → Deploy to staging.

**Jenkinsfile example:**
```groovy
if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'main') {
    deployToProd()
} else {
    deployToStaging()
}
```

---

### 34. How do you automate rollback in CI/CD?

If a deployment fails, CI/CD should automatically revert to a stable version.

**Strategies:**
- **Git Revert:** Roll back code changes.
- **Kubernetes Rollback:** `kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app`.
- **Feature Flags:** Disable a new feature without redeployment.

---

### 35. What is test-driven development (TDD), and how does it integrate with CI/CD?

TDD means writing tests before writing code.

**CI/CD Best Practice:**
- Run unit tests before merging code.
- Block deployment if tests fail.

**Example:**
```python
def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

---

### 36. How do you handle dependencies in a CI/CD pipeline?

Managing dependencies ensures consistent builds.

**Solutions:**
- Use lock files (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock).
- Cache dependencies (npm ci, pip freeze).

**Example:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

---

### 37. What is containerized CI/CD?

Running CI/CD jobs inside containers ensures consistency and isolation.

**Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.

**Example:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:16
```

---

### 38. How do you optimize CI/CD pipelines for speed?

- Run Tests in Parallel
- Cache Dependencies
- Use Lightweight Docker Images
- Only Deploy Changed Services

---

### 39. What is an approval stage in CI/CD pipelines?

An approval stage requires manual approval before deploying to production.

**Example:**
- GitLab CI/CD: `when: manual`.
- Jenkins: Use input step.

---

### 40. How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines?

Secrets should never be stored in Git.

**Solutions:**
- Vault, AWS Secrets Manager.
- GitHub Secrets (`secrets.MY_SECRET`).
- Environment variables.

**Example:**
```yaml
env:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

---

## Advanced Level (41-60 Questions)

### 41. What are self-hosted runners in CI/CD?

Self-hosted runners are custom machines for executing CI/CD jobs instead of cloud-hosted ones.

**Example:** GitHub Actions supports Linux, Windows, macOS runners.

---

### 42. How does caching improve CI/CD performance?

Caching stores dependencies and artifacts to speed up builds.

**Example: Caching npm dependencies in GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

---

### 43. What is parallel execution in CI/CD?

Parallel execution runs multiple tasks simultaneously to speed up pipelines.

**Example:** Running multiple tests at once in Jenkins.

---

### 44. What is dynamic vs. static analysis in CI/CD security?

- **Static Analysis:** Scans code before execution (e.g., SonarQube).
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Scans code during runtime (e.g., OWASP ZAP).

---

### 45. What is a feature flag, and how does it work in CI/CD?

A feature flag enables/disables features without deploying new code.

**Example:** Toggle dark mode using a flag instead of redeploying.

---

### 46. How do you handle secrets in CI/CD pipelines?

Use environment variables securely.

Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault.

**Example:**
```yaml
secrets:
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

---

### 47. What is observability in CI/CD?

Observability means monitoring logs, metrics, and traces to debug CI/CD failures.

---

### 48. What is immutable infrastructure?

Immutable infrastructure means servers are never updated but replaced instead.

---

### 49. What are the key metrics for CI/CD performance?

- **Lead Time:** Time from commit to deployment.
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** Time to recover from failures.

---

### 50. How do you ensure zero-downtime deployments?

- Use rolling updates, blue-green, and canary deployments.
- Deploy with Kubernetes and load balancers.

---

### 51. What is a release train in CI/CD?

A release train is a deployment strategy where software releases are scheduled at fixed intervals, rather than waiting for all features to be ready.

- Common in Agile environments.
- Ensures predictability and reduces deployment risks.

**Example:** Google Chrome releases every 4 weeks regardless of pending features.

---

### 52. How do you handle database migrations in a CI/CD pipeline?

Database migrations ensure schema changes are applied safely in an automated pipeline.

Use tools like Liquibase, Flyway, Django Migrations.

**Steps in CI/CD:**
1. Check migrations before deployment (liquibase validate).
2. Apply migrations during deployment (flyway migrate).
3. Rollback if failure (flyway undo).

**Example in a pipeline (Flyway):**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Apply database migrations
    run: flyway migrate -url=jdbc:mysql://db -user=root -password=secret
```

---

### 53. What is trunk-based development, and how does it impact CI/CD?

Trunk-based development means developers commit directly to the main branch (trunk) instead of using long-lived feature branches.

**Pros:**
- Faster CI/CD cycles with fewer merge conflicts.
- Reduces integration complexity.

**Cons:**
- Requires strict automated testing to prevent breaking changes.

**Example workflow:**
Commit to main → Automated Tests → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production.

---

### 54. How do you implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes?

A blue-green deployment runs two versions of an application simultaneously, allowing instant rollback if issues occur.

**Steps:**
1. Deploy new version (green) while old version (blue) stays live.
2. Switch traffic to green using a load balancer or Ingress.
3. Rollback if issues arise by redirecting traffic back to blue.

**Example Kubernetes YAML:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blue-green
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: "/"
            backend:
              service:
                name: green-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

---

### 55. What is a service mesh, and how does it help CI/CD?

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication in microservices.

**Examples:** Istio, Linkerd, Consul.

**Benefits in CI/CD:**
- **Canary deployments:** Route traffic gradually.
- **A/B Testing:** Split traffic between versions.
- **Security:** Implements zero-trust policies (e.g., mTLS).

---

### 56. What is progressive delivery in CI/CD?

Progressive delivery is an evolution of CI/CD that deploys features gradually, rather than all at once.

**Includes:**
- **Feature Flags:** Enable/disable features dynamically.
- **Canary Releases:** Test with a small user group first.
- **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions for analytics.

---

### 57. How do you handle long-running tests in CI/CD pipelines?

Long-running tests slow down deployments. Strategies to optimize:

- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run tests across multiple machines.
- **Test Selection:** Run only impacted tests using test impact analysis.
- **Mocking Dependencies:** Reduce external calls using Mockito, WireMock.
- **Shift-Left Testing:** Run tests early in the pipeline to detect failures faster.

---

### 58. What is Chaos Engineering, and how does it fit into CI/CD?

Chaos Engineering involves intentionally injecting failures to test system resilience.

**Example tools:**
- Gremlin, LitmusChaos (Kubernetes-based).
- AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS).

**In CI/CD Pipelines:**
Add a chaos test stage before production deployment.

**Example:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run Chaos Test
    run: gremlin attack --target kubernetes --cpu 90%
```

---

### 59. How do you implement immutable deployments in CI/CD?

Immutable deployments mean never modifying running instances—instead, deploying a new version entirely.

Best for containers, serverless, and cloud-native applications.

**Tools:**
- Docker images (image: my-app:v2).
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) to replace instances.

**Example:**
- **Bad approach:** ssh into a server & update the app.
- **Good approach:** Deploy a new container & replace old one.

---

### 60. What are the best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines?

To secure CI/CD, follow these best practices:

- **Use Secret Management:** Store secrets in Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict who can trigger deployments.
- **Enforce Code Signing:** Sign artifacts to ensure they are not tampered with.
- **Run Security Scans:** Use SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning tools.
- **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines:** Detect suspicious activity using SIEM tools like Splunk or Datadog.
